          >Rolling Rhino Remix</a
        >
        - I am the founder and current Project Lead of Rolling Rhino Remix.
        Rolling Rhino Remix is a Linux distribution that converts Ubuntu into a
        Rolling Release distribution. Rolling Rhino Remix has many
        distribution-specific features and utilities specifically created for
        the distribution.

          >SCAchat</a
        >
        - SCAchat is a self-hosted chatting application similar to AOL Instant
        Messenger. The chatting application is privacy-respecting and does not
        store any messages or user-data. Once a session has ended, all messages
        are gone.

        <a href="https://github.com/catiumde/skywm" target="_blank">skyWM</a>
        - skyWM is a minimalistic window manager written in Rust. skyWM takes
        inspiration from the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it
        well. skyWM has now become a part of the CatiumDE utilities and is
        maintained under one organisation.
